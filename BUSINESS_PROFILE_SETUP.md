## Issue Fixed: Business Profile Database Schema

The error `"Failed to load business profile"` occurs because the business profile columns haven't been added to the database yet. Here's how to fix it:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema
1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**: [https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gjwgrkaabbydicnwgyrw/sql](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gjwgrkaabbydicnwgyrw/sql)

2. **Copy & Paste Schema**: Copy the entire content from `supabase/business-profile-schema.sql` and paste it into the SQL Editor

3. **Run the Schema**: Click "Run" to execute all the SQL statements

4. **Verify Success**: You should see "Success" messages for each statement

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Refresh your app**: Go to http://localhost:3001/settings
2. **Check Business Profile**: The error should be gone and the business profile section should load
3. **Test saving**: Try filling out and saving business profile information
